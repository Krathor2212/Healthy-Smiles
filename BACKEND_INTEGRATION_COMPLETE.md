## Common Improvements Across All Screens

- 401 error handling (clears token, redirects to login)

### ⏳ **Loading States**
- `ActivityIndicator` with branded colors
- "Loading..." messages for better UX
- Prevents interaction during data fetch

### 📭 **Empty States**
- Custom icons (calendar, chat, credit card)
- Helpful messages ("No chats yet", "No upcoming appointments")
- Suggestions for user action

### 🎨 **UI Consistency**
- All screens use same color scheme (MAIN_GREEN: #34D399, TEXT_SECONDARY: #6B7280)
- Consistent padding, margins, border radius
- Standardized card layouts

### 🐛 **Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks on all API calls
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly alerts for failures
- Graceful fallbacks (empty arrays on error)

2. **appointmentController.js**
   - `getAppointments()` - Returns user's appointments with status filter
   - `createAppointment()` - Creates new appointment
   - `cancelAppointment()` - Cancels an appointment
   - `completeAppointment()` - Marks appointment as completed

3. **paymentController.js**
   - `getPayments()` - Returns upcoming and completed payments from appointments and orders

4. **profileController.js**

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the Expo app** to see all changes:
   ```bash
   cd D:\Healthy-Smiles\Medics
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Test all 4 screens** with real user account

3. **Verify data flow:**
   - Login → Auto-fetch app data (doctors, medicines, etc.)
   - Navigate to Chats → Should show real chat contacts
   - Navigate to Appointments → Should show real appointments
   - Navigate to Payment History → Should show real payments
   - Navigate to Edit Profile → Should load real user data, save updates

4. **Optional: Add sample data** if needed:
   - Chats: Create chat contacts in database via admin panel or SQL
   - Appointments: Book appointments through the app
   - Payments: Complete appointment bookings to generate payments

## Architecture Pattern

### Context-Based (AppDataContext)
Used for **frequently accessed shared data**:
- Doctors
- Medicines  
- Hospitals
- Articles
- Categories

**Screens:** Home, FindDoctors, PharmacyScreen

### Direct API Calls
Used for **user-specific or action-based data**:
- Chat contacts (user-specific)
- Appointments (user-specific, needs mutations)
- Payments (user-specific)
- User profile (user-specific, needs updates)

**Screens:** AllChatsScreen, AppointmentsScheduleScreen, PaymentHistory, EditProfile

---

## Environment Configuration

All screens use the centralized backend URL from:
```typescript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
const BACKEND_URL = Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.BACKEND_URL || 'http://10.10.112.140:4000';
```

Source: `.env` → `app.config.js` → `expo-constants`
